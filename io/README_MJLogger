This is the README file for the MJLogger. It is taken from the BaBar 
experiment and simplified.

MJLogger is a utility class for redirecting output to the screen by setting 
the severity the messages to be printed. The lowest level severity is 
"debugging" and the higest is "fatal". For a given severity level, anythig 
with higher severity will be routed to the output. The following is the list
of severity levels:  


 fatal:          The message is related to a condition preventing
                 further execution of the program.  MJLogger will
                 terminate the program.  Programmers should not call
                 abort or exit themselves.

 error:          A condition exists such that requested result
                 or action can not be produced.  This is a serious

 warning:        The result is produced, but may not be
                 what's desired due to an unexpected condition

 routine:        Nothing known to be wrong with the result;
                 messages that are always produced in normal
                 operation

 trace:          Messages about the flow of program control
                 and which optional operations took place.
                 (This is the default if nothing is defined)
  
 debugging:      Information in addition to the above


USAGE:
include the MJLogger.hh file in your file and use the following syntax:

   MJLog(severity) << "your message and other variables you want to
			print "  << endlog;
