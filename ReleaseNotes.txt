=======

Major changes in the Gerda part of MaGe to simulate the LAr Instrumention (N. Barros):
      - Implemented a new base system for the LAr instrumentation. It is implemented as an extension of the GerdaArray geometry.
      - Extended GerdaArray output schema to optionally include LAr Instrumentation data (if available). 
      - Added new stacking checks to reweight track priority if LAr is instrumented. Now optical photons are left to be 
        tracked at the end and they are only tracked if the any of the other tracks registered a hit in the germanium.

	- Added a new crystal type to Gerda geometry (type 3), which is used to design back-to-back BEGe's. N. Barros 
	- Implemented a new lock system (PhaseIILock) based on the old design but now having two DN250 CF flanges.
	- Implemented a two-3 string array matrix file (matrix_phase_ii_bege.txt). One of the 3-string arms is filled with 24 BEGe's.

-------------------------

- Added support for 3D reconstruction and ME to mjprocessors. R. Henning
- Added messengers to MGOutG4Step class to kill alpha and beta tracks
- Added TimeWindow functionality to MGVOutputManager class.  It is now
  possible to split up an event into several events based on a specified
  time window.  Output manager classes that derive from MGVOutputManager and
  want to use this function need to write their own versions.  This has been 
  done for MGOutputG4Steps, MJOutputDetectorEvent, and MJOutputMCEvent
  (R. Johnson)
- Added messenger to stop nuclei after one step. R. Henning
- Added LLNL 8x5 geometry. R. Henning
- Added rootplot.cxx. (R. Henning)
- Multiple changes and improvements to segmentation and PSD 
  procesoors in mjprocessors. (R. Henning)
- Corrected bug causing offset between logical and physical
  names in shield of Reference Design. (R. Henning) 
- Added general surface sampler (J. Detwiler)
- Chopped G4PhysicalVolumeStore manipulations out of
  MGGeneratorPositionSampling and put them into a new class
  MGPhysVolNavigator (J. Detwiler)
- Added base output class MGOutputASCII for text files (J. Detwiler)
- MGGeneratorG4Gun generator modified. It is now possible to sample 
  the direction of the particle isotropically from a cone, with 
  given axis and given opening angle. The option is activated through 
  a bool flag (by default it is false). Messenger changed accordingly
  (L. Pandola)
- Included a new test geometry in munichteststand/ and registered 
  in geometry/MGGeometryDetectorConstruction.cc. Added the 
  corresponding output-scheme (ASCII) and registered (L. Pandola)
- New gerdageometry/ according to the latest design (K. Kroeninger). 
  Also added PMTs in the geometry. Data & tools for the tracking of 
  optical photons for the simulation of the Cherenkov muon veto 
  (M. Knapp)
- Modified materials/ and geometry/ in order to allow the definition 
  of new materials on-the-fly. The material info are read from files. 
  It works only if the database is off (L. Pandola)
- Added functionality in G4gun generator. It is possible to generate the 
  direction of the primary particle in a cone of given opening angle 
  pointing towards a target point. (L. Pandola)
- Modified geometry/ in order to allow the definition of (simple) setups 
  directly from an external file. The geometry can include boxes, cylinders 
  and spheres (possibly nested). (L. Pandola)
- Registered new geometries in munichteststand/ used for the simulation of 
  the screening facilities in Heidelberg, and the corresponding output scheme 
  in gerdaio/ (L. Pandola)

MaGe-01-05-00: 5-Jan-2006
-------------------------
- Implementation of /dev/random for random seeds (J. Detwiler)
- First implementation of 17A geometry (R. Johnson)
- Updates to mjprocessor package (R. Henning)
- The geometry for the Gran Sasso LArGe stand is now working (L. Pandola)
- Fixed bug with volume position sampler, affecting boolean solids 
  (K. Kroeninger)

MaGe-01-01-00: 3-Jan-2006  ** <--- Does this tag exist? (Luciano) ***
-------------------------
- Updated MGOutputG4StepsData class to include name of volume. (R. Henning)
- Addition of mjprocessor package. MaGe does not depend on it (R. Henning)
