This is a brief description of the BEGe implementation for Phase I

The functionality so far comprises of one single outer DL and one single inner DL that can be specified. 
No passivation layer is physically placed but has to be logically constructed and defined in the geometry.dat
non the less. Cones and the groove are implemented and should be on opposing side. (no consistancy check is 
done!). There are two flags to set the side of the cone and the groove which are groove on bottom (=0) and 
cone on top (=0) by default. Switching both flags is essentially the same as constructing the BGEe upside down
e.g. in a back to back configuration.

The communication with the class is done via the geometry.dat which recycles old segmented detector parameters 
for the cone parametrization. The beges are a new xtal type 4 and are constructed fully independently from 
other xtals. The geometry.dat parametrization is as follows:

37  GD32B	4	0.0	35.9	32.2	0.0	300.0	840e3	840e3	840e3	1e3	 7.5	10.5	2.0	0.0	0	0	0.0	EnrichedGe 	EnrichedGe 	EnrichedGe  1.0 0.001

Phase I coaxial type holders and cabling can be used with type 4 xtals. For the holders, the placement of the 
StarHolder_UpperSpecialNut is omitted because it is crashing the drawing which suggest overlapping volumes and 
the the StarHolder_LowerContactDisc because it is almost completely covering the p+ contact. 

The new detectors are described in the geometry_PhaseIBEGes.dat and placed in the matrix_phase_i_Jul12.dat inside
the GERDA Phase I array as of July 2012. Due to some of the coaxial Phase I xtals crashing the visualization, 
there is also a matrix_phase_i_BEGeString.dat to place the BEGe string individual.

An example macro to sample and run events in the new volumes can be found here: ./macros/Gerda/RunGerda_PhaseI_Jul12.mac
