                --- Geant4 Toolkit Build  ---

Would you like to see the instructions? [n] y

This installation shell script will examine your system and ask you questions
to determine how the Geant4 Toolkit should be installed.  If you get stuck on
a question, you may use a ! shell escape to start a subshell or execute a
command.  Many of the questions will have default answers in square brackets;
typing carriage return will set the default.

On AFS it is allowed to specify either absolute or relative
paths (i.e. starting with the ~username construct).

[Type carriage return to continue]

The prompt used in this script allows you to use shell variables and backticks
in your answers. You may use $1, $2, etc...  to refer to the words in the
default answer, as if the default line was a set of arguments given to a
script shell. This means you may also use $* to repeat the whole default line.

Everytime there is a substitution, you will have to confirm.  If there is an
error (e.g. an unmatched backtick), the default answer will remain unchanged
and you will be prompted again.

Running 'Configure -d' will bypass nearly all the questions and
use the computed defaults (or answers saved in a configuration
previously generated).

Type 'Configure -h' for a list of options.

You may also start interactively and then answer '& -d' at any prompt to turn
on the non-interactive behaviour for the rest of the execution.

[Type carriage return to continue]

Much effort has been spent to ensure that this shell script will run on any
Unix system. If despite that you can't run Configure for some reason, you'll
have to set the proper environment variables by hand and follow the "manual"
installation as specified in the Geant4 Installation Guide.

[Type carriage return to continue]

Definition of G4SYSTEM variable is Linux-g++.
That stands for:

1) OS           : Linux

2) Compiler     : g++

To modify default settings, select number above (e.g. 2)
[Press [Enter] for default settings]

There exists a config.sh file. Shall I use it to set the defaults? [y]
Fetching default answers from your old config.sh file...

I can set things up so that your shell scripts and binaries are more portable,
at what may be a noticable cost in performance.  In particular, if you
ask to be portable, the following happens:

     1) Shell scripts will rely on the PATH variable rather than using
        the paths derived above.
     2) ~username interpretations will be done at run time rather than
        by Configure.

Do you expect to run these scripts and binaries on multiple machines? [n]

< Use the default answer here. The real meaning of the "multiple
machines" above is "multiple architectures". It's enough to compile
Geant4 only for YOUR architecture. >

*OPTIONS FOR GEANT4 INSTALLATION PATHS*
What is the path to the Geant4 source tree?  [/.hb/raidg01/gsoft/geant4.9.3]

< The exact meaning of this question is "Where are your unpacked
Geant4 source codes?" Say you unpack geant4.9.3.tar.gz into
/home/gx336-01/gsoft/usr, then the geant4 source codes should be in
/home/gx336-01/gsoft/usr/geant4.9.3 >

Where should Geant4 be installed?  [/.hb/raidg01/gsoft/geant4.9.3]

< The exact meaning of this question is "After a successful
compilation of the geant4 libraries, where do you like to copy the
libraries to?" >

Do you want to install all Geant4 headers in one directory? [y]

< The answer here does not effect the compilation of MaGe. However, if
you want to avoid long lists of Geant4 include paths, you can choose
to copy all its header files into one include directory. This is also
convenient for you to browse the source codes of these header
files. Besides, some of the packages, which can enhance the function
of Geant4 (GDML for example), need a yes here. If you want to install
these packages in the future, say yes. >

*GEANT4 LIBRARY BUILD OPTIONS*
Do you want to build shared libraries? [y]

< The static libraries will be included into the executable files of
your Geant4 applications, while the shared libraries won't. The shared
libraries will be used only when you run the executables. So using
shared libraries can dramatically decrease the size of the MaGe
executables. But you should let MaGe know where the shared libs are by
including the libraries directory in an environment variable named
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you have no idea what I am talking about, please
say no here. >

Do you want to build static libraries too? [n]

< If you say no to the previous question, you won't be asked this
one. >

Do you want to build global libraries? [y]

< Please say no. If you choose to use the static libraries before and
say yes to this question, the executable files of your Geant4
applications will become very large. >

Do you want to build granular libraries as well? [n]
Do you want to build libraries with debugging information? [n]

< Saying yes here will increase the size of the libraries. But you
might find the DEBUG mode very useful for your code development
later. If you don't care about the size of the libraries, give a yes
here. >

*CHECKS AND OPTIONS FOR GEANT4 PHYSICS DATA FILES*
Specify the path where the Geant4 data libraries are installed:
[/.hb/raidg01/gsoft/geant4_data]
checking for PhotonEvaporation2.0... yes
checking for RadioactiveDecay3.2... yes
checking for G4EMLOW6.9... yes
checking for G4NDL3.13... yes
checking for G4ABLA3.0... yes
checking for RealSurface1.0... yes

*CHECKS FOR CORRECT MAKE IMPLEMENTATION*
Checking for make... /usr/bin/make
Checking for gmake... /usr/bin/gmake
Checking if make is GNU make... yes
Checking if gmake is GNU make... yes

*CHECKS FOR REQUIRED EXTERNAL PACKAGE CLHEP*
checking for a CLHEP installation... /.hb/raidg01/gsoft

Is this the CLHEP installation you want to use?  [/.hb/raidg01/gsoft]

You can customize paths and library name of you CLHEP installation:

1) CLHEP_INCLUDE_DIR:           /.hb/raidg01/gsoft/include
2) CLHEP_LIB_DIR:               /.hb/raidg01/gsoft/lib
3) CLHEP_LIB:                   CLHEP
To modify default settings, select number above (e.g. 2)
[Press [Enter] for default settings]

*OPTIONS FOR GEANT4 USER INTERFACE MODULES*
Enable building of User Interface (UI) modules? [y]

< Say yes. UI (User Interface) is very useful. >

Enable building of the XAW (X11 Athena Widget set) UI module? [n]

< This enhances the Geant4 UI. If you have XAW installed in your
system, say yes; if you are not sure about that, say no. Without this
you still have a terminal-like UI. So don't worry about this too
much. >

Enable building of the X11-Motif (Xm) UI module? [n]

< This enhances the Geant4 UI. If you have XM Motif installed in your
system, say yes; if you are not sure about that, say no. Without this
you still have a terminal-like UI. So don't worry about this too
much. >

< The visualization drivers that do not depend on external libraries
are automatically incorporated into Geant4 libraries during the
compilation. The automatically incorporated visualization drivers are:
DAWNFILE, HepRepFile, HepRepXML, RayTracer, VRML1FILE, VRML2FILE and
ATree and GAGTree.

The OpenGL, OpenInventor and RayTracerX drivers are not incorporated
by default. Nor are the DAWN-Network and VRML-Network drivers, because
they require the network setting of the installed machine. In order to
incorporate them, you should say yes to the following questions: >

Enable building of the Qt UI module? [n]

*OPTIONS FOR GEANT4 VISUALIZATION DRIVERS*
Enable building of visualization drivers? [y]

< Say yes. Visualization of the detector geometries is very useful. If
you want to get some basic ideas of the Geant4 Visualization very
quickly, please search on Google "introduction to geant4
visualization". There is a not-that-long presentation which gives you
a big picture about the visualization.>

Enable building of the X11 OpenGL visualization driver? [y]

< In most of the cases, you have OpenGL installed in your system. So
saying yes here should be safe. But if you have some problems with
OpenGL, please consult to your system administrator. >

Enable building of the X11-Motif OpenGL visualization driver? [n]

< Make sure you have the XM Motif installed in your system before you
say yes. If you are not sure about this, say no. >

Enable building of the FukuiRenderer/DAWN visualization driver? [n]

< The DAWNFILE driver is automatically incorporated in Geant4. Saying
no to this question doesn't remove the DAWNFILE driver. Saying yes to
this question means that you want to install the DAWN-Network driver,
which is not necessary if you don't want to use DAWN through the
Internet. >

Enable building of the X11 OpenInventor visualization driver? [n]

< Make sure you have the OpenInventor installed in your system
before you say yes. If you are not sure about this, say no. >

Enable building of the X11 RayTracer visualization driver? [y]

< The compilation of the RAYTRACERX driver only depends on the Xlib,
which is available on most of the Linux machines nowadays. So saying
yes here should be OK. If you have some compilation problem caused by
this answer later, say no and try again. >

Enable building of the VRML visualization driver? [n]

< The VRML1FILE, VRML2FILE drivers are automatically incorporated in
Geant4. Saying no to this question doesn't remove these
drivers. Saying yes here means that you want to install the
VRML-Network driver, which is not necessary if you don't want to use
VRML through the Internet. >

You have selected to build one or more drivers that require OpenGL.
Specify the correct path (OGLHOME) where OpenGL is installed on your system.
It was found in /usr/X11R6. Press [Enter] to set this path or type the correct one.

< Now that Geant4 has already found the OpenGL, why not just use this
one. >

You can set '-' (without quotation) to CANCEL the OpenGL flag at all:
[/usr/X11R6]

*OPTIONS FOR GEANT4 OPTIONAL EXTENSION MODULES*
Enable the Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) module? [y]

< The GDML is built-in visualization utility, but it can be also used to create
the geometry from external files. It might be useful if you need to create
a very simple setup. Advantage of using it as a visualizer is that it can modularize
the output. It means that you will be able to see all parts of the detector
as separate files, which is much faster than other drivers. Say yes here if you
did not understand a word from here. >

Enable build of the g3tog4 utility module? [n] < You mostly don't need g3tog4 >
Enable internal zlib compression for HepRep visualization? [y] < Say yes if you want to use HepRepXML. >
