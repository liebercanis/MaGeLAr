\section{Common Geometries}

\subsection{Geometry From File}
To switch on the geometry definition from an external file, the messenger 
command 
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/detector GeometryFile
\end{lstlisting}
has to be given. The name of the file containing the geometry to be read 
is set using the command 
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/geometryFileName mygeometry.def
\end{lstlisting}
If the command \texttt{/MG/geometry/geometryFileName} is issued more than 
once, the file name is overwritten, and the last one is taken into account. 
If the general geometry has not been set with the command 
\texttt{/MG/geometry/detector GeometryFile}, the file name is anyway accepted 
but it is not used. If the file name is not given explicitly, the default 
\texttt{geometry.def} is looked for in the current directory. \\
It is possible to define an arbitrary 
number of boxes, cylinders and spheres. Volumes can be daughters of the 
world or of an other volume. In the latter case, it is possible to define 
``holes'' in a given volume. \\
An example of geometry definition file is the following: \\
\begin{lstlisting}
1 Crystal 2 1 0 SodiumIodide   
0. 0. 2.55 
2.55 5.10 0. 
0. 0. 0. 
2 Hole    2 0 1 Air             
0. 0. 0.65 
1.43 3.80 0.
0. 0. 0. 
\end{lstlisting}
Each volume is defined in four lines. \\
(1) The entries for the first line are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ordering number (int).
\item volume name (string). This is the name of the physical volume defined 
in the geometry. It can be used, for instance, for the uniform sampling 
routine. The names of the volumes should be different, though there is no 
specific control in the program. 
\item shape of the volume (int). The code is 1 for boxes, 2 for cylinders and 
3 for spheres. If the code is different from the values listed above, the volume  
is ignored.
\item sensitive detector flag (int). If the flag is 1, the volume is 
registered as a sensitive detector for the subsequent analysis. 
\item mother flag (int). If the flag is set to 0, the volume is placed inside the 
world volume. If the flag is a non-zero integer $n$, the volume is considered 
to be a daughter of the volume $n$. The mother volume must be defined 
\emph{before} the daughter one (namely, the ordering number of the Daugherty 
must be larger than $n$). It is possible to nest daughter volumes one inside 
the other.
\item material name. The material has to be included in the \mage database 
or defined using an external file, as described in Sect.~\ref{subsection:materials}.
\end{itemize}
(2) The second line contains the three coordinates of the volume center, given in cm (double). 
Coordinates are always expressed with respect to the mother volume reference system. \\
(3) The third line contains the three physical dimensions of the volume (double), given in cm. 
For boxes, the numbers are the sizes along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes, respectively. 
For cylinders, the first parameter is the radius, and the second the height (the 
third parameter is unused).  
For spheres, the first parameter is the radius, the other two are unused. \\
(4) The fourth line contains the three Euler angles (degrees) defining the volume rotation. 
The angles are always referred to the mother volume reference system. \\
The volumes defined in the external file are placed in a world volume made of air. The 
world volume is a cube of 5~m size. Therefore, the dimensions of the volumes in 
the file cannot exceed 5~m.\\
The geometry file presented above represents: a cylindrical sodium iodide detector (radius 
2.55~cm, height 5.10~cm) with a cylindrical hole (radius 1.43~cm, height 3.8~cm) displaced 
of 0.65~cm along the $z$-coordinate of the detector. The coordinates of the center of the 
detector are (0,0,2.55~cm) with respect to the world reference frame. The sketch of the 
geometry is displayed in Fig.~\ref{testgeometry}. \\

\end{lstlisting}

Simulates an unsegmented DSG p-type detector in the GERDAlinchen test
stand, i.e. a cryostat filled with liquid nitrogen. It includes an AEA
source inside the cryogenic liquid. 

\subsection{Heidelberg Detectors}
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/detector Bruno
/MG/geometry/detector Corrado
/MG/geometry/detector Dario
\end{lstlisting}

Simulates the three main detectors used at Heidelberg for material screening.
Includes full models of shielding and samples. The samples can be defined
by the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/sample [sphere] [box] [tube] [sbox] [liquid] [twobox]
[marinelli] [custom]
\end{lstlisting}
For different detectors replace the detector name in the command (and all following commands) accordingly, e.g. for Bruno : \texttt{/MG/geometry/bruno/sample}.\\
Description of sample options :\\
(1) The default geometry option is \texttt{sphere}, which creates a sphere of fixed radius 0.1 $\mu$m. This is used only to put the volume \texttt{sample} out of way when generating gammas from a single point.\\
(2) The outer dimensions of geometry \texttt{box} can be set by the following self-explanatory commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/boxwidth dimension [unit]
/MG/geometry/dario/boxheight dimension [unit]
/MG/geometry/dario/boxthickness dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
(3) The geometry \texttt{tube} produces a cylinder with a possible concentric hole. The dimensions can be specified by the following parameters:
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/tubelength dimension [unit]
/MG/geometry/dario/tubeouterradius dimension [unit]
/MG/geometry/dario/tubeinnerradius dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
(4) The geometry \texttt{sbox} is identical to \texttt{tube} (the same dimension-parameters apply), but adds a standard cylindrical
box used for measurements at MPIK laboratory (lid facing the detector). The position of the container changes according to the position of the sample, but the size is fixed, so it's users responsibility to ensure the \texttt{sample} volume fits inside and doesn't overlap with the container volume. The default dimensions of the sample cylinder correspond to the inner dimensions of the standard cylindrical box, so for samples which fill the inner volume completely, these parameters don't need to be specified.\\
(5) The geometry \texttt{liquid} is an extension of the \texttt{sbox} geometry. It subtracts a flat volume from the top of the sample, to simulate liquid not filling completely the volume of the standard box. For defining the liquid level, the command \texttt{/MG/geometry/dario/boxheight} is used. The value corresponds to liquid level measured from top (vertical dimension of the missing part).\\
(6) The geometry \texttt{twobox} adds two (empty) standard cylindrical containers in front of the detector.\\
(7) The geometry \texttt{marinelli} (not available for \texttt{Bruno} detector) is an extension of the \texttt{sbox} geometry. It creates a marinelli shaped sample (a box with a hole), with external dimensions defined by \texttt{boxwidth}, \texttt{boxheight} and \texttt{boxthickness} parameters, and internal hole depth and radius defined by \texttt{tubelength} and \texttt{tubeouterradius} parameters. The parameter \texttt{tubeinnerradius} is used to displace the hole from the center in vertical direction.\\
(8) The option \texttt{custom} selects additional geometry, which can't be described by previous commands, but has to be coded in the detector construction source file.\\
The following parameters define the sample position with respect to the center of the front 
detector window :
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/samplexpos dimension [unit]
/MG/geometry/dario/sampleypos dimension [unit]
/MG/geometry/dario/samplezpos dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
The command:
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/samplematerial [material name]
\end{lstlisting}
defines the material of the sample. A material with the same name has to be defined in \texttt{MGGerdaLocalMaterialTable.cc} or from external file with the \texttt{/MG/geometry/addMaterial} command, as described in Sect.~\ref{subsection:materials}.\\
Additional commands can be used with detector \texttt{Dario} to adjust the parameters of the crystal:
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/detzpos dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
Guidance: Sets the distance in \texttt{z} direction between the detector window and crystal surface.
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/deadthickness dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
Guidance: Sets the dead layer thickness.
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/detdiameter dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
Guidance: Sets outer diameter of the crystal (including dead layer).
\begin{lstlisting}
/MG/geometry/dario/detlenght dimension [unit]
\end{lstlisting}
Guidance: Sets lenght of the crystal (including dead layer).

The clover geometry models the Canberra clover detector, which  consists 
of four n-type Ge crystals. The "clover" option is the basic clover detector.
The "cloverinNaIbarrel" option produces the clover detector in an NaI veto 
barrel used for TUNL FEL testing.  The "cloverInShield" option is based on an 
experiment performed at LANL, and produces the basic clover detector in a lead 
shield, with a polyethylene moderator between the shield and detector on one 
side, as used in an experiment at LANL.  The experiment at LANL used an 
americium beryllium source, and the "cloverInShield" detector includes an 
option to create a housing for the source.  If the housing is used, its 
position must be specified.
