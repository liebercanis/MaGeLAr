   A simulation of a combined <superscript>57</superscript>Co and 
<superscript>60</superscript>Co point source located 1.5 inches 
 in front of the detector face was performed and compared to data.
 The MJ simulation package, version 1.0 was used.  
 One million decays were generated for each Co isotope 
 and the root trees were saved at 
<computeroutput>/auto/majorana1/MJ/data/LANLClover/mcdata/
</computeroutput> on PDSF.
The following script was run twice with different 
 random number seeds and output files to generate the 
 <superscript>57</superscript>Co events:

 <para> The simulated spectra were compared with data from the LANL clover. 
  Gaussian fluctuations were added to the simulated energy 
 measurements and the simulated 
 energy was converted to channel numbers using calibration
 constants from the LANL clover calibration document:

 <para>
 The measured spectrum is from the E1 channel and shows good agreement 
with the simulation, except in the low energy region. This is even
 more evident in this zoom of the low energy region: </para>

<para>The paucity of events in the backscatter region of the simulation 
is likely due to the
simulated geometry of the lead shield. The simulated lead shield was much
further away than the shield used during the measurement. This leads to 
the relative reduction  of the simulated
flux of backscatter and Pb K-shell X-Ray events. The shield geometry 
will be  corrected in the next version of the simulation.</para>

<para> The following plots show zooms of the peak regions for the two sources.
The Monte Carlo data was normalized to the background subtracted 
surface area under the two dominant peaks for each source. Each source was 
normalized separately.

<para>
The <superscript>60</superscript>Co isotope shows inconsistency in the 
width of the gamma peaks between the simulated and measured spectra. This 
is probably due to inaccuracies in the calibration constants applied to the
simulated data and is easily fixed in the next simulation release.
</para>

<para>
The qualitative analysis of the simulation of the clover detector 
presented here agrees 
well with the data; however, a more detailed quantitative analysis is
warranted. More 
simulation with different sources, as well as waveforms, are also 
planned.
The current simulation generates charge measurements for the E1, E2, E3, 
E4, L, M, and R channels. Only the E1 channel is shown here.

The use of the <superscript>60</superscript>
Co source increases the CPU time per event by a factor of 17, due to the 
higher energy involved. It may be possible to reduce the CPU time by

<section><title> Simulation setup </title>
<para>
A simulation of the propagation and energy loss of 1.02 MeV electrons in 
natural Ge 
was performed. The goal was to understand the spatial extent of the 
ionization from the electron for pulse-shape studies. The simulation was
performed on PDSF with the following script, using version 1.3 of 
<filename>MaGe</filename>:

<para>
We present some initial results from this simulation that allows us to
better understand the nature of the ionization electron cloud created by 
1.02 MeV electrons. </para>

<section><title> Electron trajectory </title>
<para>
The plot below shows a typical electron track from the simulation, projected
onto 2 dimensions, where the arrow indicates the initial position and
direction of the electron. 
The size of the squares is proportional to the energy
deposit in the column. The torturous trajectory of the electron is
apparent. </para>

<section><title> Average spatial energy deposit distribution</title>

<para>
The energy deposits for 10000 simulated electrons were averaged and projected
onto a 2-D plane. The arrow indicates the initial position and direction of
the primary electrons. It is obvious that the average energy deposit is
spatially uniform over a large region 
and that individual electron trajectories vary a lot. 
Pulse-shape and segmentation analysis would require a resolution of at least
0.4 mm, probably better, to resolve structure in the electron's track.
The slight offset in the energy deposit from the arrow
is due to binning, where the binsize was 0.01mm.

<para> 
The distance from the electron's initial position to the end of its path is
shown below. Although some of the 10000 simulated electrons travel up to 1 mm 
from their initial position, most are limited to 0.5 mm from the initial 
position.

</figure>

<para> 
As a consistency check for the simulation, the total path length (sum
of distances traveled at each simulation step) was compared to the tabulated 
average stopping range for electrons. For a 1.0 MeV electron, 
the tabulated stopping range is 1.23 mm 
(see ICRU Report 37 "Stopping Powers for Electrons and Positrons", 1984)
Below is the plot of the path-length for the 10000 1.02 MeV 
simulated electrons. 
The average simulated total path-length is 1.30 mm. The simulation and
tabulated data agree well, 
considering the very different approaches. A more detailed analysis to
understand the small differences and estimate errors will be performed.

tracking the electron. The mean is 123, confirming that the trajectory is

<para>
This initial study shows that Geant 4 can be used to compute the trajectories
of 1.02 MeV electrons. It showed that to resolve trajectory structure, 
a resolution of at least 0.4 mm is required. 
Much more work remains to be done, including:

<section><title> FEL Generator Verification </title>
<para>
The FEL generator generates a
beam of gamma rays with Gaussian distributions of  momentum and spatial 
cross-section. Plotted below are the distributions of the generated 
momentum and positions of the gammas. The gammas were generated with
a mean energy of 3.04 MeV, energy-momentum RMS of 12 keV along the z-axis, and
a vertex position RMS of 0.6 cm on the x-y plane. The plots below confirm 
that the generator 
works as expected. The FEL beam was directed along the +z direction, slightly
offset from the z-axis such that the beam illuminated the front face of the 
LANL clover at the location with the most sensitive material in the beam's 
path.

Shown below is the summed energy deposit in all four clover crystals for all
events. The detector resolution of the clover 
was not considered in this analysis, since it is
much better than the energy RMS of the FEL beam. 
The main peak at 3.04 MeV, as well as the 
Compton edge, single escape and double escape peaks are visible. The 511 Kev
annihilation line is also visible.

<para>
NaI detectors have much lower energy resolution than Ge detectors. Gaussian
fluctuations were added to the NaI detectors energy deposits on an 
event-by-event basis. The fluctuations were estimated  using the formula 
for NaI detectors from Knoll, "Radiation Detection and 
Measurement", 3rd ed. p. 330. The RMS of the added energy fluctuations at a 
given energy E is given by: FWHM(E) = E * exp(-2 -0.5 * log(E/511.0)),
where E is in keV. Shown below is the previous distribution with added 
fluctuations. 
One notices that the DEP is almost lost once the fluctuations are added.

The purpose of the segmented NaI barrel is to detect DEP events via the two

(180<superscript>o</superscript> apart). The distributions of number of

segment pairs are shown below. For all the following

a "hit."

The DEP is now much more prominent in both the Ge and NaI spectra. As a

<section><title> Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<para>
From this simple analysis, we observe that  770 events of the initial 1 
million remain in the DEP region. This is in agreement
with the initial SEGA proposal estimates of 5 million beam events to generate
1000 DEP events, since simulation of the barrel is very optimistic and does
not include seams between NaI segments. The simulation also does not factor in 
other detector effects such as dead time.
