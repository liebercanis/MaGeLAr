   <para>
     This is the Monte Carlo User's Guide for the combined simulation package
     for the Majorana and Gerda experiments. Majorana is 
     a 120-Kg. enriched Germanium crystal array that will search for 
     neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter. If you are reading this, 
     then you are probably familiar with these experiments. 
     This manual is limited
     to the Monte Carlo software. It does not discuss the design or motivation 
     of the experiments.  For more information
     about the Majorana experiment, see:

      The simulation software is under intensive development
      and subject to frequent updates. Although we will do our best to keep
      the software and User's Guide synchronized, this may not always be the 
      case.
      This manual is divided into several sections with 
      self-explanatory names:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
        <para>
          <xref linkend="GettingStarted"/> tells you how to get the required 
          computer accounts, obtain the software, build an executable
          an run some simple examples. All users and developers should read
          this.
        </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="HowTos"/> is just that. If you encounter a problem, 
            chances are someone also has also and wrote a How To. This is
            a reference for developers and users.
        </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="HW-Env"/> describes the hardware requirements
           and the
           development environment. This includes the CVS repository structure,
           build tools, releases, etc. All developers must read this. 
        </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Structure"/> describes the overall 
           framework of the simulation
           package. This includes all the top-level classes, as well as 
           naming conventions.  All developers must read this.
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Geometry"/> describes how the geometry package is
           structured, how to add new detector geometries, and how to 
	   select detector geometries
           at run-time. It also contains a description of some of the 
	   geometries. 
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Physics"/> describes the physics modules available
           to the user and how to select them. 
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="IO"/> describes how to generate output to the 
	   terminal and how to write output classes for specific
	   detectors. It also contains a description of the existing output
	   classes. Output classes describe the output format for event data
	   and are associated with specific detector geometries.

        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Database"/> describes the interface to PostgreSQL
	   database used by the Majorana collaboration.
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Waveforms"/> describes the waveform generation
	   package used for studying pulse-shapes in crystals.
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Generators"/> describes the various event generators
	   available in the <filename>MaGe</filename>
	   package and how to select and initialize them.
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Documentation"/> describes how this UDG is generated
	   and how to write documentation for it. 
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="Results"/> contains selected results and examples 
	   from the simulation. 
        </para>
     </listitem>      
     <listitem>
        <para>
           <xref linkend="QAQC"/> discusses the quality assurance and control
	   procedures for the <filename>MaGe</filename> package.
