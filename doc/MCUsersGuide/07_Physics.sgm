			The MaGe framework physics list is an amalamation of two physics lists
			that are distributed with the GEANT4 simulation package. One part of
			the list comes from the list included as part of the Underground
			Physics advanced example. The other part of the list comes from the
			QGSP_HP hadronic list. Documentation on these lists are available on
			the GEANT4 website. It manages the processes for Optical Photons 
                        (Cerenkov emission, Scintillation, Absorption) supports the cut-per-region 
                        approach: this allows to set different production cuts in different regions 
                        of the geometry.
		</para>
		<para>
			The primary class is the MGProcessesList class, but it uses
			supporting classes MGProcessesMaxTimeCuts, MGProcessesMinEkineCuts,
			and MGProcessesSpecialCuts.

		<para>
			The MGProcesses Messenger has command to set 
			the simulation "realm" to double-beta decay, 
			dark matter or cosmic rays. 
                        The difference between the realms lies in the
			secondary production cutoff. 
                        For the first two realms the distances specified in the code
			are keyed to germanium, and they provide a double-beta production
			cutoff of 100 keV and a dark matter production cutoff of 1 keV.
                        In the cosmic rays realm, the cuts are different in the volumes 
                        belonging to to the "Sensitive Region" and the other volumes. In particular, 
                        the cuts for the volumes in the sensitive region are the same than for 
                        the double-beta realm, while they are more relaxed everywhere else, in 
                        order to save CPU time (avoiding the precise tracking of particles in the uninteresting 
                        parts of the setups). 
		</para>
		<para>
			These cutoffs specify the energy below which no secondaries will
			be created (with a few excpetions, such as if the secondary
			particle would annihilate, such as positrons, or if the particle
			is relatively close to a volume boundary).
		</para>
		<para>
			The goal of establishing these different realms is to increase the
			speed of the simulation when possible. Since the interesting energy
			range of double-beta decays is much greater than that of dark
			matter interactions, the simulation should not have to spend so
			much time tracking secondary particles down to the lower energy
			ranges.
		</para>
                <para>
                        If no logical volume is registered in the "Sensitive Region", the cut-per-region 
                        approach has no effect in the simulation. The cuts are the same everywhere and 
                        correspond to about 140 keV (gammas) and 7.5 MeV (e-) in germanium. 
                        The code to register one logical volume in the "Sensitive Region" is 
                 	<cmdsynopsis>
				<command> G4Region* sensitiveRegion = G4RegionStore::GetInstance()->GetRegion("Sensitive Region"); 
                                </command>
                                <command> sensitiveRegion->AddRootLogicalVolume(myLogicalVolume); </command>
			</cmdsynopsis>
                       When a volume is registered to the region, all its daugthers are included too.
                </para>
		<para>
			The MGProcesses Messenger is used as such:

			<cmdsynopsis>
				<command>/MG/processes/realm</command> <arg><replaceable>BBdecay</replaceable></arg> <arg><replaceable>DarkMatter</replaceable></arg> <arg><replaceable>CosmicRays</replaceable></arg>

			The default realm is "BBdecay".

                <para>
                   Geant4 has the capability to generate and track optical photons, e.g. originated by scintillation or by 
                   Cerenkov emission. In the default MaGe Physics List optical photons are not generated. They can be switched 
                   on with the messenger command 
                   <screen>
			<cmdsynopsis>
				<command>/MG/processes/optical</command>
				<arg><replaceable>true</replaceable></arg>
                                <arg><replaceable>false</replaceable></arg>
			</cmdsynopsis>
			</screen>
                   that has to be given before the <cmdsynopsis><command>/run/initialize</command></cmdsynopsis>. In this case, 
                   be sure that the geometry definition contains the optical properties of materials (refraction index, absorption 
                   lenght, scintillation yield) and of surfaces (reflection index, etc.).
                </para>
                <para>
                   Geant4 provides two alternative sets of Electromagnetic Processes, called Standard (Std) and Low Energy (LowE). 
                   The LowEnergy processes include atomic effects (as fluorescence) and can track gammas, electrons and positrons 
                   down to 250 eV; the drawback of LowE processes is that they require a longer computing time. By default, the 
                   Electromagnetic processes in the MaGe Physics List are the LowE ones. One can switch to the Standard processes 
                   (quicker and less precise) with the messenger command

                  It must be given before the <cmdsynopsis><command>/run/initialize</command></cmdsynopsis>.
