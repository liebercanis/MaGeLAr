   <filename>MGLogger</filename> class.</title>
   <para>
   The <filename>MaGe</filename> package comes with a terminal output class
   that handles messages you want to write to the screen. A message is written
   to the screen only if its severity exceeds that of the current severity 
   setting. The allowed severity levels
   are: <filename>debugging, trace, routine, warning, error, fatal</filename>.
   The severity level is set via a Geant 4 messenger at run-time. 
   For example, if we set
   the severity to <filename>warning</filename> :
   </para>
<screen>
MG/manager/mglog warning
</screen>
   <para>then the following line of code will produce terminal output:</para>
<screen>
MGLog(warning) &lt;&lt; "Your Warning here " &lt;&lt; endlog;
</screen>
   <para> 
    However, if the severity level is set higher at run-time, to 
    <filename>error</filename> or <filename>fatal</filename>, then nothing
    will be written to the screen. Remember to put an 
    <filename>endlog</filename> at the end of your statement. If you have a
    statement that is set to <filename>fatal</filename>, nothing is written
    to the screen, and the program is stopped immediately.
