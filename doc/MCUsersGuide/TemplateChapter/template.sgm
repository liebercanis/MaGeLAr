   The simulation software resides on a CVS server at LBNL and is currently
   only supported on the 
   <ulink url="http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/PDSF"> <citetitle> 
   PDSF </citetitle> </ulink> 
   facility. PDSF is a Linux cluster running RH
   7.3 and you will need a shell terminal program to access it.
   If you do not have accounts on these
   machines, please follow the instructions posted on the 
   <ulink url="http://neutrino.lbl.gov/majorana/HOW-TOs.html">
   <citetitle> Majorana simulation
   website </citetitle> </ulink> to obtain access. Once you have access,
   follow the instructions on the website to set up your environment 
   correctly.

  <section> <title> Checking out and building the simulation package. 
  </title>
  <para>
  Once you have accounts on PDSF with the proper environment you can check 
  out and build the simulation 
  package. This process is semi-automated and can be invoked via the 
  following set of instructions from a PDSF login shell:
   <screen>
      mkdir workdir
      cd workdir
      getRel 01.00
      cd MJ_01.00/MJ
      gmake installdirs
      getPkg management
      getPkg macros
      gmake management.bin
      ln -s /auto/majorana1/MJ/generators/PNNL/dat dat</screen>
  </para>

  <section> <title> Running the simulation </title>
  <para>
   The simulation can be run interactively or with Geant 4 scripts.
   There are three scripts currently in the macros package, 
   <screen>Co60.mac</screen>, <screen>Co57.mac</screen>, <screen>
   Th.mac</screen>. These scripts generate gammas from Co60, Co57 and Th122
   sources places approximately 1.5 inches in front of the front face of
   the clover face. The macros can be executed via 
   To run icp tnteractively, type <screen> bin/MJApp </screen>
