This directory contains MaGe and ROOT macros showing how to use GDML
with MaGe and ROOT.

g42gdml.mac  - dump a simple detector setup "Corrado" from MaGe into
   	       gdml files

Corrado.gdml - mother gdml file containing the whole setup

    * Crystal_log.gdml - daughter gdml file containing only the
      		       	 logical volume "Crystal_log"
    * Spider_log.gdml  - daughter gdml file containing only the
      		         logical volume "Spider_log"

drawGDML.C - ROOT macro showing how to visualize GDML in ROOT. (You
	     have to enable GDML support in ROOT by passing
	     "--enable-gdml" option to the configuration
	     process. You'd better also enable OpenGL support in ROOT:
	     $./configure --enable-gdml --enable-opengl) 

gdml2g4.mac - read gdml file in, run a simple simulation based on the
	      geometry inside the gdml file
