This file will list and explain the different directories contained in the "macros"-directory of MaGe.

-------------------------------------
     ***GDML***

Contains the example macros "g42gdml.mac" and "gdml2g4.mac" which are used to illustrate the use of GDML and the conversion of data from Geant4 to GDML and back.
A short README-file in the directory informs you in more detail.
 
-------------------------------------
     ***Gerda***

Contains various macros to describe the geometries of the complete Gerda setup and of the different teststands built in Munich. They start with "Draw..." and will visualize the particular geometries.
The "Run..." macros give you the opportunity to simulate different measurements with the Gerda geometries.
More information about each macro can be found in the README-file of the Gerda directory.

-------------------------------------
     ***Majorana***

Contains macros with geometries typical for Majorana.

-------------------------------------
     ***Samples***

Contains sample files to show how to work with different particle generators (SampleGenerators.mac)and what options to use for different geometries(SampleGeometries.mac). 
A file named "SampleTemplate.mac" shows the general structure of a MaGe macro and can also be used as a template by switching the options on and off.
