General Info
============

The directory contains patches on Geant4 source codes. The basic usage is:

  $ patch someG4sourceFiles < somePatch

If you change some *.cc files do be sure to recompile the relative G4 libs.
And you'll have to recompile MaGe if you use static G4 libs. If you only
change some *.hh files you don't have to recompile G4 libs but don't forget
to copy the changed header files to $G4INCLUDE directory.

File list
=========

* bug956patch
-------------

     patch to fix G4 bug #956, i.e. "meta stable states are missing". After the
     patch 95% of the neutron capture process, n + 76Ge, will create the meta
     stable state of 77Ge. Data for other meta stable states are not available
     and are not applied here.

     usage:

       $ patch g4sourceDir/processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp/src/G4NeutronHPCaptureFS.cc < bug956patch
       $ cd g4sourceDir/
       $ source env.sh or env.csh
       $ export G4WORKDIR=... (optional)
       $ cd g4sourceDir/processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp/
       $ make

     recompilation of MaGe is needed afterwards. The patch works for all G4.9.x
     till now.

* Geant4.9.2p02-gdml.patch
* Geant4.9.3-gdml.patch

     Choose your patch according to your version, otherwise it might not work.
     Or, look at these patches and replace according strings: 3 necessary plus
     some comments (change them on your own)

     The patch concerning gdml writing [to external .gdml files]. This patch CAN be
     applied (but not necessarily) if you want to name the output files according
     to their logical volumes. Otherwise it will be named as

       --  depth3_module5.gdml   etc.

     Usage:

       $ patch g4sourceDir/persistency/gdml/src/G4GDMLWrite.cc < Geant4.9.2p02-gdml.patch
       or
       $ patch g4sourceDir/persistency/gdml/src/G4GDMLWrite.cc < Geant4.9.3-gdml.patch

       The rest steps are as in the previous patch. Do not forget to recompile MaGe!
